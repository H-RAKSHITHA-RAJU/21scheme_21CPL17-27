COMPUTER PROGRAMMING LABORATORY- 21SCHEME<br>
PART A – List of problems for which student should develop program and execute in the Laboratory<br>
<ol>
  <li>Simulation of a Simple Calculator.</li>
  <li>Compute the roots of a quadratic equation by accepting the coefficients. Print appropriate messages.</li>
  <li>An electricity board charges the following rates for the use of electricity: for the first 200 units 80 paise per unit: for the next 100 units 90 paise per unit: beyond 300 units Rs 1 per unit. All users are charged a minimum of Rs. 100 as meter charge. If the total amount is more than Rs 400, then an additional surcharge of 15% of total amount is charged. Write a program to read the name of the user, number of units consumed and print out the charges.</li>
  <li>Implement Binary Search on Integers / Names.</li>
  <li>Implement Matrix multiplication and validate the rules of multiplication.</li>
  <li>Compute sin(x)/cos(x) using Taylor series approximation. Compare your result with the built-in library function. Print both the results with appropriate inferences.</li>
  <li>Sort the given set of N numbers using Bubble sort.</li>
  <li>Write functions to implement string operations such as compare, concatenate, string length. Convince the parameter passing techniques.</li>
  <li>Implement structures to read, write and compute average- marks and the students scoring above and below the average marks for a class of N students.</li>
  <li>Develop a program using pointers to compute the sum, mean and standard deviation of all elements stored in an array of N real numbers.</li>
  <li>Implement Recursive functions for Binary to Decimal Conversion.</li>
</ol><br>
PART B – Practical Based Learning<br>
<ol>
  <li>Calculation of Simple Interest,</li>
   <li>Check whether the given number is even or odd</li>
   <li>Convert string case</li>
   <li>Check for palindrome</li>
   <li>check for prime number</li>
   <li>check for perfect square</li>
